Customer Review Sentiment & Emotion Analyzer

This project leverages advanced NLP techniques to analyze customer reviews by performing:
	•	Sentiment Analysis (positive, negative, neutral),
	•	Emotion Detection (e.g., happiness, anger),
	•	Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),
	•	Multilingual Review Support (via mBERT & XLM-R),
	•	Explainable AI (XAI) integration using SHAP & LIME.

It’s designed to process real-world e-commerce data and deliver actionable insights through visualizations like sentiment trend graphs and word clouds.

🚀 Features
	•	🔍 Sentiment Classification: Classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
	•	😄 Emotion Detection: Identify underlying emotions like joy, anger, sadness, etc.
	•	🎯 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA): Analyze sentiment at the feature level (e.g., battery life, screen quality)
	•	🌍 Multilingual Analysis: Built using mBERT & XLM-R to support global datasets
	•	🧠 Explainable AI: Integrated SHAP and LIME to visualize model decision logic
	•	📊 Visual Insights: Word clouds, sentiment/emotion trends over time

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Models: BERT, mBERT, XLM-R, DistilBERT
	•	NLP Tools: Transformers (Hugging Face), NLTK, SpaCy
	•	Explainability: SHAP, LIME
	•	Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
	•	Frontend: Streamlit / React (optional)
	•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
	•	Deployment: Docker (optional)
